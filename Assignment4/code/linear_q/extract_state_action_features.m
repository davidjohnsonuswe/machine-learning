function [state_action_feats, prev_grid, prev_head_loc] = extract_state_action_features(prev_grid, grid, prev_head_loc, nbr_feats)
%
% Code may be changed in this function, but only where it states that it is 
% allowed to do so.
%
% Function to extract state-action features, based on current and previous
% grids (game screens).
%
% Input:
%
% prev_grid     - Previous grid (game screen), N-by-N matrix. If initial
%                 time-step: prev_grid = grid, else: prev_grid != grid.
% grid          - Current grid (game screen), N-by-N matrix. If initial
%                 time-step: prev_grid = grid, else: prev_grid != grid.
% prev_head_loc - The previous location of the head of the snake (from the 
%                 previous time-step). If initial time-step: Assumed known,
%                 else: inferred in function "update_snake_grid.m" (so in
%                 practice it will always be known in this function).
% nbr_feats     - Number of state-action features per action. Set this 
%                 value appropriately in the calling script "snake.m", to
%                 match the number of state-action features per action you
%                 end up using.
%
% Output:
%
% state_action_feats - nbr_feats-by-|A| matrix, where |A| = number of
%                      possible actions (|A| = 3 in Snake), and nbr_feats
%                      is described under "Input" above. This matrix
%                      represents the state-action features extracted given
%                      the current and previous grids (game screens).
% prev_grid          - The previous grid as seen from one step in the
%                      future, i.e., prev_grid is set to the input grid.
% prev_head_loc      - The previous head location as seen from one step
%                      in the future, i.e., prev_head_loc is set to the
%                      current head location (the current head location is
%                      inferred in the code below).
